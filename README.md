- get_constant_value
    -The function get_constant_value takes two input arguments: constant, which is the name of a physical constant, and unitSystem, which specifies the unit system in which the value of the constant is desired (either 'SI' or 'eV'). The function then loads a list of physical constants and their units in the specified unit system and returns the value of the requested constant in the specified units. The output of the function is a scalar value representing the value of the requested constant in the specified units.
